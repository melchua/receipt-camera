# Paperless Receipt: IOS Camera/Web App
### An App to Make Employee Expense Reports Easier!

Paperless is a mobile application that let employees scan and send business expense receipts directly to their admin department. The app uses Google Vision and some backend logic to auto-magically parse out the important receipt information such as total and date. This information is easily accessed by both employees and admins from an easy to use web-interface.

## Motivation
This project was birthed from a final project idea our team had at the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp in June 2018. As fairly new web developers, we wanted to tackle some new technologies that were not taught during our bootcamp. As web developers, we were far removed from mobile apps, so we decided to learn React Native and Google Vision's API in the span of 3 days to create this app. 

Through this we learned teamwork, as well as how to work in an Agile / Kanban style methodology to complete a functioning application in the span of 8 days.
